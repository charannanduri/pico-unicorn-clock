# Clock on the Unicorn Hat with Raspberry Pi Pico

This program displays a clock on the pimironi unicorn 17 x 7 LED Matrix display for raspberry pi pico.
requires PicoUnicorn library. If anyone can make the number binary font matrix smaller that would be great. 
If that happens then this program will fit directly on the Pico's flash. 
Also feel free to extrapolate this and use it for other stuff. One Idea I had was to use it for sports scores or weather.
There is code that inspired me from @katspaugh that is below.
